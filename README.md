#### How to install:

1.) Download the repository by selected the big, green "Code" button at the top of this page.

2.) Select "Download ZIP"

3.) Locate the downloaded .zip file. Unzip the file in the location of your choice.

4.) Download Eclipse IDE if you haven't already

5.) Create a new java project in the Eclipse IDE

6.) Move all files from the repository folder into your new project folder

7.) Right-click on the package explorer in eclipse, select "Refresh"

8.) Your game is now installed!

 

#### How to execute: 

1.) Open eclipse project

2.) Open Main.java

3.) Select the green "Run Main.java" option in the top left

 

#### How to Interact:

On launch, you'll be greeted with a main menu with 3 options. 

"Start Game" will bring you to another Menu where you can select 1 of 2 currently available games. "War" will start up a game of War and "BlackJack" will
start a game of Blackjack. 
In War, you can click anywhere on the window and the program will automatically take the top card off of yours, and the enemy's deck and compare the two. The
game ends when one player has 0 cards left.
In Black Jack, you will be greeted with your current cards as well as an option to "hit" or "hold". The "hit" option will give you another card and hold will 
reveal the cards the dealer has and determine who is the winner.
In Solitaire, you will be greeted with a near-fully-built Solitaire board. Sadly, this game is not-functional at this time, but you can admire our GUI handiwork.

"User Menu" will bring you to another Menu where you can add new users to your machine. To add a new user you can click "Add New User" at the bottom of the screen
and it will prompt for a personalized tag and a password. To log in as a user, you must click the "Select User" button and you will be prompted to input your password.
From there this will save the number of wins in Black Jack as well as the best time in a game of War by selecting "View Selected User". The first person on the machine 
is set to an admin by default and admins have the ability to delete other users, make others admins, and take away admin privileges. 

"Exit" will close the program.

If you need any help while using the program, there should be a "Help" menu in the top-left corner of the game. That menu will have most of the answers you may be looking for.
